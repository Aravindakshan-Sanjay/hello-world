# hello-world
This is my debut in github

Hey this is Aravindakshan, a homosapien that has been in the existence for the past 20 years.
I am new to github and im doing this as a part of my online data science course that i am taking. 
I study electronics and communication engineering in a reputed private college and am currently in the 3rd year.
That's about it for my first github.
